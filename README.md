> This app is made for people who organise events and want to have one folder for every picture of videos took doring the said event.

P.S.  Adding a file to a folder is anonymous , meaning that anyone with the folder's code can add any file without the other users seeing who added the file.

### Creating or Joining the folders

<div style="flex-direction: row;" >
    <img src="./assets/createscreen.jpg" width="300" height="628" />
</div>

> In this screen users can create or join a folder but the joinning it is done using the next screen.

<div style="flex-direction: row;" >
    <img src="./assets/search.jpg" width="300" height="628" />
</div>

> The users can search and join the folders by simply searching for the code or simply scan a QR code.
